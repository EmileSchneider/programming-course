# Abstraction

A programming language instructs a computer to perform tasks.
It helps us organize our ideas about processes. To do so it 
provides us with means to combine ideas to form more complex ideas.

Every programming language has the following things:
- primitive expressions

the simplest entities the language is concerned about
- means of combination

by which compound elements are build from simpler ones
- means of abstraction

by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
